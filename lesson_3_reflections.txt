When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    When we want to have copy of local repository, we can use remote repositiory ( pushing changes from local to remote) 
    and we can access the local repo from anywhere.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    Because  in remote repository changes can be added which may not be necessary to us.Since remote repository is having public access,any one can add feature, so we can check commit history in remote repo and can manually give pull requests when we need the changes .

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

    Forks - is used to have a copy of github(others) repository in github directly from github without making any local copies of repository.
    Clones- is used to have clone/copy the files from remote to local or between locals
    Branch - is used to add new experimental/unique features to repository by creating them in a manner such that they vary after a commit which can be later merged 

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?

    We can do our work from the place where the remote copy had been left with all changes incorporated instead of having a old file(not updated version).
